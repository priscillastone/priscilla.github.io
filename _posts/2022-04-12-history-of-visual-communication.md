I don't know where this is exactly going to go, but suddenly, I am experiencing a great resent. A refreshing of the mind, a recalibration in my mindset, goals, emotions, fulfillments, and so much more. Suddenly, I am shedding almost a decade of wanting something that I really thought was my calling. Perhaps, in another Universe.

However, I find myself in this one. I am not sure what was the catalyst for it, well, perhaps I do, but I will go into that later, but I woke up one morning over the summer just wanting and ready for something different. Something new. I could almost feel it, smell it, taste it. I felt like it was one of those weird dreams when you're trying so hard to make something out and you're sort of squinting to sharpen the mirage on the horizon: that is what it felt like. But instead of me approaching it, it was approaching me. Almost as if it was a fast-moving train quickly coming close, I could feel the vibrations of the rumbling, the sound of the horn, the wind blowing my hair back and along with it old desires and expectations. And suddenly... my new journey had arrived. 

I didn't ask for it. I didn't expect it. But little did I realise that I was more than ready. My heart and soul had been waiting for this for longer than I had suspected or known. Every fibre in my being and every atom that's apart of me suddenly synchronised in harmony on the same vibration of this train. It was time. And this was my path. And nothing was going to stop me. 

I can't wait to share more about this and the adventures this reawakening already catapulted me into. It's effected literally everything in my life, and more the best. I can't wait to see where this goes. I have a strong feeling I slightly know.

With love,

P.S.

Communication design can also refer to a systems-based approach, in which the totality of media and messages within a culture or organization are designed as a single integrated process rather than a series of discrete efforts. This is done through communication channels that aim to inform and attract the attention of the people you are focusing your skills on. Design skills must be tailored to fit to different cultures of people, while maintaining pleasurable visual design. These are all important pieces of information to add to a media communications kit to get the best results.

> “Don’t design for everyone. It’s impossible. All you end up doing is designing something that makes everyone unhappy.”

Communication design seeks to attract, inspire, create desires and motivate the people to respond to messages, with a view to making a favorable impact to the bottom line of the commissioning body, which can be either to build a brand, move sales, or for humanitarian purposes. Its process involves strategic business thinking, using market research, creativity, and problem-solving. Communications designers translate ideas and information through a variety of media. Their particular talent lies not only in the traditional skills of the hand, but also in their ability to think strategically in design and marketing terms, in order to establish credibility through the communication.

The term communication design is often used interchangeably with visual communication, but has an alternative broader meaning that includes auditory, vocal, touch and smell. Examples of communication design include information architecture, editing, typography, illustration, web design, animation, advertising, ambient media, visual identity design, performing arts, copywriting and professional writing skills applied in the creative industries.

The identification of self-esteem as a distinct psychological construct is thought to have its origins in the work of William James (1892). James identified multiple dimensions of the self, with two levels of hierarchy: processes of knowing (called the ‘I-self’) and the resulting knowledge about the today.
