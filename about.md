Hi! I'm Priscilla. After 10 years of working in Marketing and Fashion, and truly enjoying it, I’m pursuing an entirely new journey: my goal is to study Theoretical Physics formally and gain a degree eventually in the field. I’m an avid traveler, reader, futurist, quantum physics enthusiast, and I describe myself as a storyteller that is always curious. I’m experience-driven, so I really want to stimulate emotion and I hope my journey resonates with others. I’m a solo parent of a wonderful 9 year old boy.
