Hi! **I’m Priscilla and welcome to my blog.** It features my personal experiences and covers travel, personal growth, academia, books, and everything in between. After 10 years of working in marketing in the consulting and tech world, I’m slowly making room for an entirely new journey.  

I'm an avid traveler, reader, futurist, and purpose-driven storyteller. My ethos is to combine resilience with curiosity and passion, which in my opinion, you can never go wrong with.

I’m a solo parent of a wonderful 9-year-old boy and we both love the cosmos, reading, adventures, and the mountains.
